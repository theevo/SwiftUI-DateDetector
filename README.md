#  SwiftUI Date Detector

## Premise

Date Pickers are slow and clunky. Heaven forbid you're old like me and have to scroll the year wheel to 1978.

We type faster than we can scroll.

Let's type in our dates rather than spin 3 wheels.

## Completed

âœ… Interprets what you type in and knows what the date value is
âœ… No need for delimiters like "-" or "."; just type the numbers for month, day, and year

## Ideas

- animation
- validation (what if i enter a "ðŸ’©ðŸš½" or "13" for the month?)
- internationalization
